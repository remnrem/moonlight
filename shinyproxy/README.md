# ShinyProxy
ShinyProxy is your favourite way to deploy Shiny apps in an enterprise context.<br />
When deploying a Shiny application with ShinyProxy, the application is simply bundled 
as an R package and installed into a Docker image.<br /> Every time a user runs an application, 
a container spins up and serves the application.


# Installation

## 1) Java 8

#### Download and Install [OpenJDK like Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk)
* Select Java version 8 LTS
```
sudo apt install ./zulu8.68.0.19-ca-jdk8.0.362-linux_amd64.deb
```

## 2) Docker

#### Download and Install [Docker for ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

ShinyProxy needs to connect to the docker daemon to spin up the containers for the Shiny apps.<br /> 
By default ShinyProxy will do so on port 2375 of the docker host.<br /> In order to allow for connections on port 2375, 
the startup options need to be edited.<br /> Edit `/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` and replace the relevant line with
```
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -H unix:// -D -H tcp://127.0.0.1:2375
```
Next, save the file, close the editor and restart Docker using:
```
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

## 3) ShinyProxy
#### Download and Install [ShinyProxy](https://www.shinyproxy.io/downloads/)
```ruby
 shinyproxy_2.6.1_amd64.deb
 ```
 To install shinyproxy run
 ```
 sudo apt install ./shinyproxy_2.6.1_amd64.deb
 ```

## 4) Pulling the demo image 
In order to run ShinyProxy, you need Shiny apps. In ShinyProxy such Shiny apps are typically shipped in docker containers and the `openanalytics/shinyproxy-demo` is a demo image that has been made available to start playing with Shiny Proxy.

Once docker is installed on your system, you can pull (i.e. download) the docker image with the demo applications using
```
sudo docker pull openanalytics/shinyproxy-demo
```
## 5) ShinyProxy configuration
ShinyProxy looks for a [configuration](https://www.shinyproxy.io/documentation/configuration/) file called `application.yml` in the `/etc/shinyproxy directory`. Let's create this file:
```
touch /etc/shinyproxy/application.yml
```
Copy the blow configs to `application.yml`
```
proxy:
    title:
    landing-page: /
    heartbeat-rate: 15000
    heartbeat-timeout: 900000
    port: 9191
    container-wait-time: 800000
    container-log-path: ./container-logs
  
    authentication: none

    docker:
      internal-networking: false
      url: http://localhost:2375
      port-range-start: 20000

    specs:
    - id: euler
      display-name: Eulerâ€™s number
      container-cmd: ["R", "-e", "shiny::runApp('/root/euler')"]
      container-image: openanalytics/shinyproxy-template
 ```
 ## 6) Running ShinyProxy 
ShinyProxy can be run using the following command
```
systemctl restart shinyproxy
```
Less than 10 seconds later, you can point your browser to http://localhost:9191 and use your Shiny apps!<br />
More advanced information on the usage and configuration of ShinyProxy is available on the [Configuration](https://www.shinyproxy.io/documentation/configuration/) page.
